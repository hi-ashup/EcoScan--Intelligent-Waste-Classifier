### **packages.txt**

The `packages.txt` file is used by deployment platforms like **Streamlit Community Cloud** or **Heroku** to install system-level (OS) dependencies via `apt-get` (Linux) that aren't Python libraries.

For EcoScan, we don't strictly *need* anything heavy like ffmpeg or libgl because we rely on the standard `Pillow` library and Streamlit's built-in camera, which runs in the browser. However, ensuring basic image support tools are present is good practice.
